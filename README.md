# The-American-Refugee

"In March of 2011, disastrous events in Syria led to the formation of a civil war and one of the world's most pressing and devastating current conflicts. These actions have led to global debates, among them the refugee crisis.

The American Refugee is a simulated adventure game that transposes the events of the Syrian Civil War into the modern-day United States.

What would you do in this situation? If you were a refugee, what choices would you make? Where would you go? Would you even survive?

Tap to begin."

This was an app I worked on and had on the Apple App Store for several years.

I have since taken it down (it's expensive to keep apps on there!), but I wanted to just upload the code aspect of the app on here for memory's sake.

Due to the amount of space the files take up when including the artwork for the app, those have been removed.
